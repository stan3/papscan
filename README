*** NOTE: This file is out of date ***

== Pre-installation checklist ==

* bash (tested with 2.05b)

* python (tested with 2.3.4)

* sed for installation configuration

* Something to start the script e.g.
  vcron (or another crond that can run commands at startup)
  /etc/rc.local file
  init with agetty (or getty with similar capabilities)

* sane-backends
* sane-frontends (for scanadf)
* ghostscript (for ps2pdf)
* netpbm (for pnmtops)
* imagemagick (for convert, if using monochrom)
* PIL - python image library (if using monochrome.py)

optional
* use a separate keyboard on a ps2 mouse port with ps2key

== Installation ==

* copy config.sh.sample to ~/papscan.sh and customize

* update paths for new installation; run
  $ su - scan
  $ make config
  in script directory, where "scan" is the user the script will be run as
  (requires permission to access scanner)
  
* add something equvalient to this to /etc/inittab
  c7:3:respawn:/sbin/agetty -n -l "/path/to/initscan.sh" 38400 tty7 linux
  then 
  # init q

* (optional) use chvt (part of kbd) to switch to the right virtual console 
  on boot
  e.g. put "/usr/bin/chvt 7" in rc.local

In pdf files JBIG or CCITT fax compression can be used for monochrome images.
pnmtojbig (from netpbm) for info on jbig implementation
ps2pdf will use CCITT compression if it detects a monochrome postscript files.
convert -resize needs to use the Point -filter to remain in monochrome.
reportlab doesn't appear to use CCITT compression

convert experiements (with ImageMagick 6.0.7)

-contrast doesn't seem to help much
experimented when using -monochrome (from gray mode scanned image)
  gamma - use
    all with gamma 2
    contrast - no change?
    dither - no change?
    enhance - slightly worse
    equalize - much worse
    modulate 120 - slightly better, mainly for text on coloured background
    modulate 100,50 - no change?
    modulate 100,150 - no change?
    modulate 120,150 - better as above
    all with gamma 2 and modulate 120
      normalize - text slightly more blurred
  gamma vs modulate
    gamma 2.5 looks clearer than modulate 180

  reducing to 2 colors looks slightly better in gimp (2.0.4)
    image -> mode -> indexed -> Use Black and White Palette and 
                                                           No Colour Dithering

=== Grayscale/Color ===

Can use DCT/JPEG compression in pdf files.
Can't seem to set the level of compression used (e.g. 75% etc)


=== scanadf redesign ===

running a program at the end of each page scanned --scan-script option

add new swithes for
  piping data to a command for each page scanned
  running a program at the end of the scan <- wait for command to terminate
